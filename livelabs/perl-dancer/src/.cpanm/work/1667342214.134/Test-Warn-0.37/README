SYNOPSIS

      use Test::Warn;

      warning_is    {foo(-dri => "/")} "Unknown Parameter 'dri'", "dri != dir gives warning";
      warnings_are  {bar(1,1)} ["Width very small", "Height very small"];

      warning_is    {add(2,2)} undef, "No warning to calc 2+2"; # or
      warnings_are  {add(2,2)} [],    "No warning to calc 2+2"; # what reads better :-)

      warning_like  {foo(-dri => "/"} qr/unknown param/i, "an unknown parameter test";
      warnings_like {bar(1,1)} [qr/width.*small/i, qr/height.*small/i];

      warning_is    {foo()} {carped => 'didn't found the right parameters'};
      warnings_like {foo()} [qr/undefined/,qr/undefined/,{carped => qr/no result/i}];

      warning_like {foo(undef)}                 'uninitialized';
      warning_like {bar(file => '/etc/passwd')} 'io';

      warning_like {eval q/"$x"; $x;/}
                   [qw/void uninitialized/],
                   "some warnings at compile time";

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a few convenience methods for testing warning based

    the time to go take a look.
