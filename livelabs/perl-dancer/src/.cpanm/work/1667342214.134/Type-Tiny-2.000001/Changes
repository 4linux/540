2.000001	2022-09-29

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Avoid uninitialized warnings when creating a union between an Enum type
   and a non-Enum type.
   Diab Jerius++

 [ Documentation ]
 - Clearer documentation of Types::TypeTiny::to_TypeTiny.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - No longer report Type::Tie version at start of test suite, as Type::Tie
   is now bundled.

2.000000	2022-09-23

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Minor fix for Class::Plain-related tests.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Repackage Type-Tiny 1.999_013 as a stable release.

1.999_013	2022-09-23	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview N

 [ Documentation ]
 - Document usage with Class::Plain.
 - Fix pod typo in manual.
   Florian Schlichting++
 - Improvements to Type::Params documentation.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Test usage with Class::Plain.

 [ Other ]
 - Type::Params signature_for will respect inheritance when looking for
   methods to wrap, when the `method` option is true.

1.999_012	2022-09-21	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview M

 [ Documentation ]
 - Document in Type::Tie that Type::Tie is implicitly loaded when you tie a
   variable to a Type::Tiny type constraint. (It was already documented in
   the manual.)
 - Document the Type::Tie::BASE `type` method.
 - Removed stub pod from a bunch of internal modules. They're internal, so
   nobody should be expecting pod.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Bundle a (renamed) copy of Type::Nano in the test suite for some tests
   combining Type::Nano and Type::Tiny type constraints, and converting
   Type::Nano to Type::Tiny.
 - Improved test cases for Type::Tie with an aim at 100% coverage.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Add Class::XSAccessor to Type::Tiny's recommendations.

 [ Other ]
 - Adding a type constraint to a type library will now also add it to the
   library's type registry. (Even though this registry is unlikely to be
   used.)
 - Rewrite much of Type::Tie to no longer use inside-out objects and avoid
   a dependency on Hash::Util::FieldHash or alternative implementations of
   fieldhashes.
 - Type::Parser's internal packages now have version numbers.
 - Type::Tie now supports variables being cloned with Clone::clone(). It
   already supported Storable::dclone().
 - Type::Tie will now try to load Class::XSAccessor::Array for a speed-up.
 - Using Type::Utils to declare a named type will now automatically add the
   type to the caller's type registry.

1.999_011	2022-09-20	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview L

 - Added: Bundle Type::Tie which was previously in a separate distribution
   on the CPAN.

1.999_010	2022-09-18	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview K

 [ Test Suite ]
 - More tests.

 [ Other ]
 - Eval::TypeTiny::CodeAccumulator now supports $coderef->compile(alias =>
   1).
 - If the `ws parameter is set to true in parameterized DelimitedStr type
   constraints, leading and trailing whitespace will now be permitted.
 - Non-parameterized DelimitedStr now has a coercion from ArrayRef[Str].
 - The ${^TYPE_PARAMS_MULTISIG} magic global variable is now called
   ${^_TYPE_PARAMS_MULTISIG}. The old name will still be supported for at
   least six months after the next stable release.

1.999_009	2022-09-16	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview J

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Another test for `-base`.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Types::Common::String now has a DelimitedStr type.
 - Improve cache key generation for parameterized types.
 - Minor improvements to the default name generator, used to generate the
   display_name for parameterized type constraints.

1.999_008	2022-09-14	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview I

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - More sensible error message trying to import a type constraint using
   -declare outside a type library.
   Diab Jerius++

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Type::Tiny now has an exportables_by_tag method.
 - Added: Type::Tiny::_DeclaredType is now a separate module. (It was
   previously defined inline in Type/Library.pm.)
 - Eval::TypeTiny::type_to_coderef() can now handle being passed undef as a
   type constraint and will create a Type::Tiny::_DeclaredType object to
   wrap instead.
 - If a type library has been made immutable, you can no longer add new
   types and coercions to it.
 - Type::Params `signature_for` will now delay most of the signature
   compilation until the function is called for the first time, like
   `wrap_subs`/`wrap_methods` used to do. It still does enough up-front to
   detect some common errors in signatures.
 - Various Type::Library cleanups.

1.999_007	2022-09-13	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview H

 [ Documentation ]
 - Fix pod formatting issue in Type::Params.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Improved test cases; now 100% coverage on coveralls.io.

 [ Other ]
 - Minor refactoring, mostly to make things more easily testable.

1.999_006	2022-09-12	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview G

 [ BACK COMPAT ]
 - If none of a multisig's alternative sigs match the parameter list
   ${^TYPE_PARAMS_MULTISIG} will be explicitly set to undef, instead of
   being left as-is.
 - The Eval::TypeTiny::HAS_LEXICAL_VARS constant no longer exists. It was
   deprecated in Type-Tiny-1.004000 (2018-07-27).

 [ Other ]
 - Get the `multiple` option working with the `signature_for` function from
   Type::Params.
 - Improved test cases and miscellaneous small bugfixes for slurpy
   parameters in Type::Params.

1.999_005	2022-09-11	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview F

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - What was supposed to be a warning for slurpy+default in Type::Params was
   throwing an exception. Corrected to be a warning.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Minor improvements to Type::Params documentation.

 [ Other ]
 - The functionality provided by Type::Params::multisig() is now provided
   in the Type::Params v2 API. (And is slightly more functional!)

1.999_004	2022-09-09	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview E

 [ Documentation ]
 - Minor documentation clarifications around new constructor methods for
   Type::Tiny subclasses.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Add versions of tests for the new Type::Params v2 API which don't rely
   on Perl 5.20 features.
 - More tests for Type::Tiny::{Class,Duck,Enum,Role} exporting.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Require Exporter::Tiny 1.004001.

 [ Other ]
 - Type::Tiny::{Class,Duck,Enum,Role} subclass Exporter::Tiny instead of
   handling exports manually.

1.999_003	2022-09-09	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview D

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Setting a default for a slurpy parameter in Type::Params now warns and
   ignores the default instead of failing to compile because of a syntax
   error.
   Zhtwn++

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Move two helper subs out of Type::Library and into
   Eval::TypeTiny, clean them up, and document them as part of the API
   (set_subname and type_to_coderef).
 - Added: Type::Tiny now has an `exportables` method which provides a list
   of functions that the type can export. Type libraries now defer to this
   when deciding what they can export.
 - Added: Type::Tiny::Class is now an exporter.
 - Added: Type::Tiny::Duck is now an exporter.
 - Added: Type::Tiny::Enum has an is_word_safe method which indicates
   whether all values in the enumeration are 'words' (i.e. contain only
   word characters).
 - Added: Type::Tiny::Enum is now an exporter.
 - Added: Type::Tiny::Role is now an exporter.
 - Added: Word-safe enumerations export constants for each value.
   Branislav Zahradník++
 - Major simplifications of Type::Library internals.
 - The NICE_PROTOTYPES constant has been moved from Type::Library to
   Eval::TypeTiny, though a copy of it is still available in Type::Library
   for backwards compatibility.
 - The intersection of two Type::Tiny::Enum objects is now a
   Type::Tiny::Enum instead of a Type::Tiny::Intersection.
   Branislav Zahradník++
 - The union of two Type::Tiny::Enum objects is now a Type::Tiny::Enum
   instead of a Type::Tiny::Union.
 - Type::Params will call default coderefs as a method for signatures where
   method => 1.

1.999_002	2022-09-07	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview C

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Types::Common was not correctly handling the -sigs export tag.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Fix up some heading levels in the pod for Type::Params.
 - Update NEWS.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Better tests for `strictness` option in Type::Params.
 - Improved tests for slurpy handling in Type::Params.
 - The internal module Type::Params::Signature now has some tests of its
   own.

 [ Other ]
 - Minor bugfixes and improvements to slurpy handling in Type::Params.
 - The type_default method will accept parameters, and sort-of curry them.

1.999_001	2022-09-05	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview B

 [ Documentation ]
 - Fix misspelling of 'GitHub' in documentation.
 - Further revisions of Type::Manual.
 - Update the SYNOPSIS for Types::Standard and Type::Tiny.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Tests for the `type_default` of all builtin types.

 [ Other ]
 - Changes to the `type_default` for a few parameterized types.
 - Types::Common now also extends Types::TypeTiny.

1.999_000	2022-09-04	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview A

 [ Documentation ]
 - Updated Type::Tiny::Manual to cover new features.

 [ Other ]
 - %Error::TypeTiny::CarpInternal is now an alias for %Carp::CarpInternal.
 - Added: Type::Tiny `type_default` method.
 - Added: Type::Tiny overloads `/`.
 - Added: Types::Common module.
 - The Type::Params API has had a major overhaul, introducing `signature`
   and `signature_for` functions. The `compile`, `compile_named`,
   `compile_named_oo`, `validate`, `validate_named`, `wrap_subs`, and
   `wrap_methods` functions are now considered the legacy API. There are no
   plans to drop support for the legacy API in the foreseeable future.
 - Updated: Dropping support for Perl 5.6.1 (which was released in April
   2001), 5.6.2 (November 2003), and Perl 5.8.0 (July 2002). Type::Tiny now
   requires at least Perl 5.8.1.
 - Updated: Require Exporter::Tiny 1.004000+. (Previously required
   Exporter::Tiny 1.000000.)

1.016010	2022-08-31

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix an uninitialized warning when calling compile_named_oo outside a
   sub.
   Diab Jerius++

 [ Documentation ]
 - List which versions of Perl Type::Tiny requires in
   Type::Tiny::Manual::Policies.

1.016009	2022-08-27

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Parameterizable type constraints have a name generator, which is a
   coderef that generates the names of their parameterized child type
   constraints. The default name generator now strips ASCII control
   characters (such as null, tab, and new line) from names it generates.
   sbuggles++

1.016008	2022-08-14

 - Added: Type::Params now has a `goto_next` option, which if set to a
   coderef will generate a signature which on success, instead of returning
   @_, passes @_ to the coderef. If `goto_next` is set to true, the
   signature instead expects to be passed such a coderef as its first
   argument.
 - Eval::TypeTiny::CodeAccumulator now better handles placeholders.
 - Type::Params `wrap_subs` and `wrap_methods` internally use `goto_next`.

1.016007	2022-08-04

 - Added: Type::Params now has a `strictness` option, which if set to false
   (or certain strings of Perl code that evaluate to false) will skip type
   checks apart from when needed for coercions, skip parameter count
   checks, and skip checks for unknown named parameters. You generally
   don't want to set it to false or indeed set it at all.

1.016006	2022-07-25

 [ Documentation ]
 - Added a new page to the manual: Type::Tiny::Manual::UsingWithMite.

 [ Other ]
 - Type::Tiny now overloads 0+ to return a unique number per type
   constraint.

1.016005	2022-07-23

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Minor bugfix in Type::Tiny::cmp where in some cases it was returning '0'
   instead of '0E0'; unlikely to affect anything.

 [ Other ]
 - Updated: Updated Type::Params benchmarking scripts.
 - When Type::Registry/Type::Parser has to create a class or role type
   constraint, use Types::Standard InstanceOf/ConsumerOf instead of
   creating new anonymous Type::Tiny::Class/Type::Tiny::Role constraints.

1.016004	2022-07-22

 - Added: Type::Params now allows named parameters to have aliases.

1.016003	2022-07-22

 - Catalyst was relying on the internals of the old slurpy function. Next
   release of Catalyst should fix that, but this version of Types::Standard
   introduces a workaround for the issue without going back to implementing
   Slurpy the old way. (The Catalyst test suite passes at least!)
 - In most places that accept a Slurpy, happily accept a child of a child
   of a child of Slurpy.
 - Rename Type::Params::Coderef to Eval::TypeTiny::CodeAccumulator as it's
   not really Type::Params-specific. Add test cases for it and make it part
   of the public API.
 - Use Eval::TypeTiny::CodeAccumulator in compile_match_on_type.
 - When Type::Tiny's is_subtype_of, etc methods are called passing a string
   as a parameter, pay attention to calling package's type registry.

1.016002	2022-07-19

 [ BACK COMPAT ]
 - The slurpy(Foo) function from Types::Standard has been replaced by a new
   Slurpy parameterized type, so you can use Slurpy[Foo] instead. A
   slurpy() function is still provided for backwards compatibility, but if
   you were relying on the internal detail that this used to return an
   unblessed hashref, this release might break that assumption.

1.016001	2022-07-18

 - Allow Type::Utils::extends to extend Type::Library::Compiler libraries.
 - Allow the add_types method of Type::Registry to consume
   Type::Library::Compiler libraries.
 - Improved coercion of Type::Library::Compiler's type constraints to
   Type::Tiny.

1.016000	2022-07-16

 - Add a clone option to parameters in Type::Params to clone them with
   Storable::dclone(). This is mostly a test of how much easier improving
   Type::Params is since it was refactored.

1.015_003	2022-07-16

 - The simple case of compile() with no parameters was broken by
   refactoring. It should now work.

1.015_002	2022-07-16

 - Defaults for Type::Params parameters can now be a reference to a string
   of Perl code (like Mite).

1.015_001	2022-07-16

 - Type::Params::Signature now avoids using the word `return` in its
   generated source code, as MooX::Press was using that as a talisman. Also
   avoid using the `return` keyword to return the final results of the
   signature check, as falling through performs better on older Perls, plus
   it enables MooX::Press to convert the coderef into a do{} block.

1.015_000	2022-07-16

 [ BACK COMPAT ]
 - Type::Params is now smarter at calculating the expected $#_ for
   functions which take named parameters, so it can 'fail early' more often
   when there are extra parameters or missing required parameters. This
   means you may get errors indicating the wrong number of parameters when
   you were previously getting errors indicating particular unrecognized or
   missing required parameters. This may break test suites which were
   looking for particular error messages.

 [ Other ]
 - Major refactoring of Type::Params, splitting out signature compilation
   into separate backend OO-modules which Type::Params now acts as a
   frontend for. Compiling signature checks is probably now a little
   slower, but once they're compiled Type::Params is still the fastest Perl
   implementation of typed parameter checks. This refactor should make the
   code easier to work with, add new features to, and tweak the performance
   of.

1.014000	2022-06-27

 [ Documentation ]
 - Update copyright dates to 2022.
 - Various minor documentation improvements.

 [ Test Suite ]

 [ Other ]
 - Added: $Type::Tiny::SafePackage variable.
 - Added: Error::TypeTiny now has a `throw_cb` method which acts like
   `throw` but takes an initial callback parameter.
   jsf116++
 - Added: Type::Params `compile`, `compile_named`, and `compile_named_oo`
   functions now support an `on_die` callback.
   jsf116++
 - Eliminate warnings while generating deep explanations for type
   constraint check fails under some circumstances. (Mostly affects
   StrMatch when Regexp::Util isn't installed.)
   James Wright++

1.013_001	2022-06-23

   StrMatch when Regexp::Util isn't installed.)
   James Wright++

1.012005	2022-06-07

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Ensure coderefs returned by overload::Method are called with three
   parameters, as passing two parameters can break subs imlpemented in XS.
   Hugo van der Sanden++
 - Fix explanation message for NumRange/IntRange
 - Prevent stringification of Error::TypeTiny from clobbering $@.
   bokutin++

 [ Documentation ]
 - Fix typos in documentation for wrap_methods from Type::Params.

1.012004	2021-07-29

 [ Documentation ]

   parameter didn't use qr// properly.
   Lucas Tiago de Moraes++

1.012003	2021-05-09

 [ Documentation ]
 - Fixed typo in Type::Tiny::Enum where the `closest_match` method was
   documented as being called `closet_match`.

 [ Other ]
 - Type::Parser now supports negative hexadecimal integers.

1.012002	2021-05-02

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix precendence error in generated code for Tuples.
   Philippe Bruhat++
   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny/pull/64>

 [ Documentation ]
 - Fixed typo in pod for Type::Tiny::Enum
   Windymelt++
   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny/pull/70>

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Fix testcase for Tuples with slurpy HashRef to pass a literal hashref
   (which should fail) instead of an arrayref (which should also fail, but
   less subtly).
   Philippe Bruhat++
   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny/pull/64>
 - Type::Tiny is no longer routinely tested on Perl versions older than
   5.8.1.
   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny/actions>

 [ Other ]
 - Type::Parser now supports hexadecimal integers.
   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny/issues/71>

1.012001	2021-01-10

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Extra test cases to improve coverage. (100% on Coveralls; 90% on
   Codecov.)
 - Hide warnings in Kavorka integration tests.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Move issue tracker from RT to Github Issues.
 - Stop hiding Type::Parser::Token, Type::Parser::TokenStream, and
   Type::Parser::AstBuilder from the CPAN indexer.

 [ Other ]
 - Much code tidying using perltidy and manually.
 - When generic validation objects (blessed objects with a `check` method)
   are converted to native Type::Tiny type constraints, no longer require
   them to provide a `get_message` method. This allows Type::Tiny to adopt
   Data::Constraint type constraints.

1.012000	2020-10-28

 [ Documentation ]
 - Update NEWS file.

1.011_011	2020-10-16

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Bugs in old versions of Return::Type prevent integration tests from
   passing on Perl 5.8.x; those tests now require Return::Type 0.007 or
   above.
 - More tests for Type::Coercion::FromMoose.

 [ Packaging ]
 - If the EXTENDED_TESTING environment variable is true, Perl 5.8.9 or
   above is being used, and either Type::Tiny's version contains '_' or
   testing is running on Travis CI, then Makefile.PL will add extra testing
   dependencies.

 [ Other ]
 - Remove unnecessary BEGIN block in Eval::TypeTiny.

1.011_010	2020-10-16

 - Simple useful coercions from Str for Type::Tiny::Enum (and
   Types::Standard::Enum).

 [ Documentation ]
 - Add _ForeignTypeConstraint to AllTypes.pod.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Add tests for _ForeignTypeConstraint.
 - Improve test coverage by adding tests for various esoteric parts of the
   distribution and edge cases.

 [ Other ]
 - More efficient use of Type::Tiny::XS by Types::TypeTiny.
 - Refactoring of Types::TypeTiny.
 - Where various parts of Type::Tiny internally use type constraints to
   check values, prefer is_* and assert_* functions over method calls.

1.011_008	2020-10-07

 [ Documentation ]
 - Some minor tidyups and updates to Type::Tiny::Manual.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Better tests for the placeholder type constraints created by
   Type::Library -declare flag.
 - Test integration with Type::Nano as an example of a generic
   non-Type::Tiny type constraint class.
 - Test that $type->() works with subclasses that override the
   assert_return method.
 - Write tests for some internal undocumented methods.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Type::Utils::assert() function.

1.011_007	2020-10-06

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - ArgsObject inlining was closing over a coderef in a way that didn't work
   on archaic versions of Perl. Resolve by calling the coderef outside the
   closure.

1.011_006	2020-10-02

 [ Documentation ]
 - Include JSONCapable type example.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Improved test coverage for Type::Library.
 - Improved test coverage for Type::Params.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Type::Params now exports an ArgsObject type constraint.
 - Test::TypeTiny's should_pass and should_fail exercise type constraints
   in even more ways in EXTENDED_TESTING mode.

1.011_005	2020-09-30

 - Added: Type::Library import now supports -extends and -utils flags.
 - Type::Library -base import flag now marks the caller package as loaded
   in %INC.

1.011_004	2020-09-30

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Make predeclared type constraints work better for Zydeco.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Document that ArrayLike and HashLike are now parameterizable.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Make test suite work better with App::Yath.

1.011_003	2020-09-25

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Old versions of Data::Dumper would sometimes die when dumping certain
   overloaded objects. Type::Tiny::_dd() now catches this in an eval {}.
 - Types::Standard would sometimes complain about very old versions of
   Scalar::Util.

 [ Other ]
 - ArrayLike and HashLike are now parameterizable, though the
   implementation for the parameterized version is in pure Perl, not XS.
 - Type::Tiny::Enum better caches regexps.
 - Updated: ArrayLike, HashLike, CodeLike, and StringLike type constraints
   can use XS if Type::Tiny::XS 0.022 is installed.

1.011_002	2020-09-22

 - Added: Type::Utils now exports an `is` function but it needs to be
   requested explicitly.

1.011_001	2020-09-21

 [ Documentation ]
 - Update the NEWS file.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Add new list processing functions to Type::Tiny.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Describe deficiencies of is_* functions for parameterized types.
   Fixes RT#132918.
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132918>

 [ Other ]
 - Type::Tiny::Enum now generates faster regexps to validate enums. (Code
   stolen from Regexp::Trie.)

1.010006	2020-09-04

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Eliminate recusion warnings when Type::Parser needs to parse complex
   types.
   Fixes RT#121957.
   Diab Jerius++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121957>

 [ Other ]
 - Better handling of coercions for pre-declared types in Type::Library.
   The type objects created before the type was properly defined will now
   lazily attempt to find coercions from the properly defined type once it
   becomes available.

1.010005	2020-08-26

 - Improvements to $AvoidCallbacks support for
   Type::Tiny::{Class,Role,Duck,Enum,Union,Intersection}, and LaxNum, Ref,
   RegexpRef, FileHandle, Object, Overload, and Tied types from
   Types::Standard.

1.010004	2020-08-18

   Philippe Bruhat++

1.009_002	2020-02-11

 [ Documentation ]
 - Mention MooX::Pression.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Type::Params now supports `head` and `tail` options for
   `compile`, `compile_named`, and `compile_named_oo`.
 - Parameterized `Ref` type constraint in Types::Standard now checks its
   parameter is a known Perl ref type.
 - Type::Params on Perl older than 5.10 now uses its own B::perlstring
   implementation to quote strings instead of using B::cstring.

1.009_001	2020-02-06

 [ Test Suite ]
 - More tests for recursively defined type constraints.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Type::Tiny::Enum now has an `as_regexp` method.
 - In some edge cases, the regexps used by Type::Tiny::Enum will now be
   slightly faster.

1.009_000	2020-02-04

 - Subclasses of Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint are now converted to the
   appropriate subclasses of Type::Tiny by Types::TypeTiny::to_TypeTiny,
   instead of always being converted to the base class. This improves
   inlining amongst other things.
 - When types are declared by Type::Library's -declare import parameter,
   the temporary subs installed can now generate placeholder type
   constraints which allow the types to be used in recursive type
   definitions.

1.008005	2020-01-30

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Remove some Perl 5.012+ syntax from test suite.

1.008004	2020-01-29

 [ Documentation ]
 - Fix typos.
   Hauke D++

 [ Other ]
 - Type::Tiny didn't accept string constraints for parameterizable type
   constraints; this was not a documented restriction and didn't seem to
   serve any purpose, so the restriction has been lifted.
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131238>

1.008001	2019-12-28

 - Types::TypeTiny honours $Type::Tiny::AvoidCallbacks.

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fixes for some edge cases in the overidden `can` method on old Perl
   5.8.x versions for types with the secret `is_object` parameter set to
   true. (There were problems in 5.8.1 but 5.8.9 was okay; not sure the
   exact version where the delta was that affected it. Either way, fixed
   now.)

   Fixes RT#125839.
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=125839>
 - Type::Params will now keep a reference to all type constraints passed to
   it; this may use more memory in some cases, but will improve exceptions
   thrown.
   Fixes RT#121763.
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121763>
 - Type::Tiny better mimics the Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Parameterized

   <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129729>
 - When extending a MooseX::Types library, be more careful checking to see
   if types have coercions, because a Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion object may
   be an empty list of coercions.
   Fixes RT#102748.
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=102748>

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Add a test that Specio type constraints can be converted to Type::Tiny
   types, and inlining works.
 - Bundle some tests for Types::ReadOnly because it does interesting stuff
   with coercions and parameterizable types.
 - Bundle test from RT#104154, which turned out to not be a bug.
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=104154>

   mostly out of date. Use RT instead.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Many type constraints now support `stringifies_to`,
   `numifies_to`, and `with_attribute_values` methods. Type::Tiny 1.006000
   accidentally included an undocumented early implementation of these with
   some differences.
 - Added: Provide a control over whether types are allowed to make
   callbacks in inlined code.
 - Added: Type::Tiny::ConstrainedObject exists as a superclass for
   Type::Tiny::Class, Type::Tiny::Role, and Type::Tiny::Duck.
 - Added: When Types::TypesTiny::to_TypeTiny converts a Moose/Mouse type to
   a Type::Tiny type, the returned type will now be parameterizable if they
   original type was parameterizable.
 - Added: When importing type constraints from non-Moose/non-Mouse blessed
   type constraint systems (Specio, Types::Nano, others?), support
   inlining.
 - Smarter caching and reuse of parameterized types.

   current implementation of alias => 1.
 - Eval::TypeTiny will now throw errors when it detects a mismatch between
   sigils and reference types in the environment hashref but only if

   you its own error message for this later on anyway.
 - Improve progressive exporter in Types::TypeTiny to avoid loading
   Exporter::TypeTiny more often.

   André Walker++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=101582>
   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny/pull/16>
 - StrMatch changes in previous release broke the ability to check type
   equality between two parameterized StrMatch types under some
   circumstances. Changed how the hash key for stashing regexp references
   gets built — is now closer to the old way. This doesn't revert the
   change in 1.001_012 where regexp checks can be inlined better, but only
   applies to those regexp references that can't easily be inlined.

1.001_012	2017-05-17

 [ BACK COMPAT ]

 - Improvements and clarifications to Type::Coercion documentation.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Add tests for Error::TypeTiny::Assertion's predicate methods.
 - Add tests for Type::Coercion's i_really_want_to_unfreeze method.

 [ Other ]
 - Better integration between Type::Library and Type::Registry. If you
   import a type constraint from a Type::Library-based module, it will
   automatically be inserted into your modules' type registry.
 - The to_Foo functions exported by Type::Library-based modules are now
   significantly faster. (But only if the type's coercion is frozen.)
 - Type::Utils::dwim_type now takes into account what OO framework the
   caller is using (Moose or Mouse) if it needs to fall back to asking the
   OO framework about a type constraint.

0.047_08	2014-08-05	Sanity++

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix non-inlined version of NegativeOrZeroInt.

 - Test to avoid the "too few arguments for type constraint check
   functions" error.
   Diab Jerius++
   <http://purl.org/NET/cpan-uri/rt/ticket/97684>
 - Update t/30-integration/Moose/coercion.t to Moose 2.1200 which throws an
   exception rather than printing a warning when coerce=>1 is used on a
   type constraint with no coercions.

 [ Other ]
 - Prevent inlining of coercions if they've not been frozen.
   <http://purl.org/NET/cpan-uri/rt/ticket/93345>

0.047_06	2014-07-31	What made the Queen go all ice crazy?

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Bugfix in coercion inheritance where the child's type_coercion_map
   arrayref would end up as a reference to the parent's type_coercion_map.
   (Which was not good.)

 [ Test Suite ]
 - More Type::Registry test cases.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Type::Coercion now has a i_really_want_to_unfreeze method.
 - Added: Type::Library now has a make_immutable method.
 - Coercions for the types defined in Types::Common::Numeric are now
   frozen.
 - Coercions for the types defined in Types::Common::String are now frozen.
 - Coercions for the types defined in Types::Standard are now frozen.
 - Parameterized types now have their coercions frozen automatically, so
   you can no longer add coercions to, say, ArrayRef[Int]. However, you can
   create a subtype of ArrayRef[Int] and add coercions to that.
   Michael G Schwern++
   <http://purl.org/NET/cpan-uri/rt/ticket/97516>
 - Type::Registry now has methods for creating
   union/intersection/class/role type constraints. Type::Parser delegates
   to these, making it potentially reusable outside Type::Tiny by simply
   passing it an alternative type registry object.
 - Type::Registry/Type::Parser will now auto-load MouseX::Types libraries.

0.047_05	2014-07-29	Sanity++

 [ REGRESSIONS ]
 - Introduced bug concerning coercions to parameterized Dicts with a
   mixture of inlineable and non-inlineable optional values.

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix for slurpy Map within a Tuple.
 - Types::TypeTiny->has_type was incorrectly returning whether
   Types::TypeTiny contained the named *coercion* instead of a named
   *type*.

 - Check Type::Library-based type libraries can extend MouseX::Types-based
   type libraries.
 - Check that Type::Registry works in conjunction with MouseX::Types.
   (There's some TODO stuff there.)

 - Fake a very old Validation::Class::Simple for a certain test by
   overriding $Validation::Class::Simple::VERSION.

   (find_parent/is_supertype_of/is_subtype_of/is_strictly_supertype_of/is_s
   trictly_subtype_of).
 - Test the immutability of Type::Coercion::Union.
 - Tests for `isa`.
 - Tests for non-inlineable type constraints in `match_on_type` and
   `compile_match_on_type`.

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - More sensible use of Sub::Name in Type::Library.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Added a Type::Tiny::Manual::Optimization perldoc page.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Type::Tiny now has a `where` method which is a shortcut for
   creating a child type with a constraint coderef.
 - Added: Type::Tiny now has an `of` method which is a shortcut for
   `parameterize` which I can never spell properly.
 - Restore and improve Mouse XS stuff dropped in Type-Tiny 0.045_03.

   removed. (I do plan on restoring it, and improving it.)

 [ Documentation ]
 - Update benchmark scripts, showing results with/without Type::Tiny::XS.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - When testing equivalence between Types::Standard types and core Moose
   types, don't test `Num` because Types::Standard provides two different

 [ Documentation ]
 - Type::Tiny::Manual links to various parts of the test suite to document
   concepts. These links had grown stale and have now been updated.
 - Updated NEWS file.

0.041_01	2014-03-17

 [ BACK COMPAT ]
 - Type::Tiny and Type::Coercion no longer overload addition. This feature
   never really worked very well with regard to precendence, requiring lot
   of parentheses to use. The overload also made solving the
   parameterizable type coercion problem very difficult.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Because of changes to Data::Dumper in Perl 5.19.x, the test suite was
   previously skipping some Dumper-based test cases depending on Perl
   version. However, Dumper is dual-lifed, so older versions of Perl may
   have shiny, new Dumpers. Skip test cases based on Data::Dumper version
   instead.

 - Weak reference from Type::Coercion objects to target type constraint

 - Type::Parser no longer provides a `tokens` function as it no longer
   pre-emptively tokenizes the whole string it is given.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Type::Parser now provides a `extract_type` function which parses
   a type constraint expression from the head of a string and returns a
   Type::Tiny object, plus the tail of the string. (This is designed to
   make it easier to use Type::Parser to parse things like function

   Peter Flanigan++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=86383>
 - Unions of Type::Tiny and Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraints now work properly.
   This makes Type::Tiny and MouseX::Types play nice together (much like
   Type::Tiny already plays nice with MooseX::Types).

 [ Other ]
 - Cleanups within Type::Coercion. Necessary because in some places the
   entire type_coercion_map (including conversion coderefs) was passed
   through Types::Standard::to_TypeTiny, when really only the type
   constraints should have been.
 - Types::Standard::to_TypeTiny now accepts any object implementing the
   Type::API::Constraint or Type::API::Constraint::Coercion interfaces. As
   Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraint implements this interface, specific support
   for importing Mouse types has been dropped; the generic Type::API import
   'just works' for Mouse types.
 - Types::Standard::to_TypeTiny now accepts unblessed coderefs and converts
   them to type constraints. This allows things like `Int & sub { $_ < 10
   }` to work.

 - Make rt86172.t an 'xt' test case because it's causing random CPAN
   testers failures unrelated to the feature it's supposed to be testing.
   <http://purl.org/NET/cpan-uri/rt/ticket/86172>
 - More test cases for interacting with MooseX::Types type constraints.

 [ Other ]
 - If a Type::Tiny object is instantiated with a Sub::Quote quoted
   constraint coderef, and no inlined coderef, then Type::Tiny will use
   Sub::Quote to make an inlined coderef.
 - Subclasses of Type::Tiny reject 'inlined' coderef, just like they
   already reject 'constraint' coderef.
 - Type::Params no longer uses Type::Utils.

 - Allow subtypes to inherit coercions from their parent type constraint.
   (They do not by default.)
 - Build coercions automatically for certain type parameterized
   constraints. Say there's a Num->Int coercion defined; then we should be
   able to coerce ArrayRef[Num]->ArrayRef[Int].
 - Overload "+" operator for Type::Coercion and Type::Tiny allows coercions
   to be added to each other, and added to type constraints.
 - Type::Library packages can now include "standalone" Type::Coercion
   objects, not attached to a type constraint. These can be exported on
   request.
