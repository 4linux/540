NAME

    File::Share - Extend File::ShareDir to Local Libraries

SYNOPSIS

        use File::Share ':all';
    
        my $dir = dist_dir('Foo-Bar');
        my $file = dist_file('Foo-Bar', 'file.txt');

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a dropin replacement for File::ShareDir. It supports the
    dist_dir and dist_file functions, except these functions have been
    enhanced to understand when the developer's local ./share/ directory
    should be used.

    NOTE: module_dist and module_file are not yet supported, because
    (afaik) there is no well known way to populate per-module share files.
    This may change in the future. Please contact me if you know how to do
    this.

PROBLEM AND SOLUTION

    Module::Install has an install_share directive that allows you to
    install various files associated with a distribution. By convention,
    module authors always put these in a directory called share/. However,
    File::ShareDir can only find files after they have been installed. This
    can be problematic when running development tests.

    File::Share will look for a local share directory, if it notices that
    the module corresponding was loaded from a development path.

    Devel::Local gives you an easy way to use a bunch of source
    repositories as though their lib and bin directories had already been
    installed. File::Share lets you play along with that.
